    Added ``redacted_copy`` method to ``RequestContext``. This returns a copy
    of the context with secrets redacted. This will allow downstreams that
    inherit and enhance the ``RequestContext`` can include the additional data
    in the redacted copy if they wish by overriding the ``redacted_copy``
    method.
