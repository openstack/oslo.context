upgrade:
  - |
    The following arguments, first deprecated in 2.19.1 (Queens), have now been
    removed.

    - `user` (replaced by `user_id`)
    - `domain` (replaced by `domain_id`)
    - `user_domain` (replaced by `user_domain_id`)
    - `project_domain` (replaced by `project_domain_id`)

    If you are still using the legacy aliases, simply replace e.g. `user` with
    `user_id` in your calls and `RequestContext` subclasses.
